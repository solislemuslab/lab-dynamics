# Offboarding steps

We are sad to see you go, but excited for the new posibilities in your future!

Steps before you leave the lab:

1. Make sure to document all your work and leave an updated version of any incomplete project in github. If you have files in the cluster, make sure to clean them up and back up anything that you need to take with you
2. Remove yourself from the [lab website](https://solislemuslab.github.io//pages/people.html) (repo [here](https://github.com/solislemuslab/solislemuslab.github.io)) and add yourself to the "Past members" section. Please include where you will be (if you already know) and include a link to your website. You will do this via a pull request. You should be familiar with github by now, but if you are not sure how to do this, check some github resources [here](https://github.com/crsl4/mindful-programming/blob/master/lecture.md)
3. Email Pat Pointer and Em Craft from WID to let them know that you will leave my lab so that she update your WID account (either remove it or change it to other lab). Please copy me in this email
4. Fill out the offboarding form with your new contact information [here](https://forms.gle/Utj4pTHwMe456zyMA). This is so that I can reach out regarding our projects together (publications, extensions to our work, presentations,...)

Note that you will keep access to your project slack workspace, but not to the lab slack workspace which will be reserved for current lab members only.
