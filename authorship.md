# Authorship guidelines in the Solis-Lemus lab

- The trainee (student/postdoc in the lab) taking the lead role can expect to be the first author of published work
- Others who help over the course of the project will have the opportunity to earn co-authorship
- We are open to collaborations with equal contributions and first co-authorship
- The first author is responsible for:
    - Writing the [project plan](https://github.com/solislemuslab/lab-dynamics/blob/master/project-plan.md) (often in collaboration with other members of the research team)
    - Leading the project
    - Conducting all analyses
    - Writing the manuscript
    - Revising the manuscript and corresponding with the journal or publisher
    - Obtaining approval of all coauthors on the final draft
    - Understanding the general principles of all the work included in the manuscript.
- Claudia will be the senior author (last author) and corresponding author
    - Being last and corresponding author signals that this is a paper from the Solis-Lemus lab 
    - The senior author’s responsibility is 
        - to guide the trainee’s analyses, 
        - to provide detailed feedback on all aspects of the work (analyses, presentation of results, writing) and 
        - to conduct careful editing of the draft prepared by the trainee before it can be sent out for publication
- Claudia makes the final decision on authorship and readiness for publication. All authorship is tentative until acceptance
- Discussing authorship at the start of a project is just a start as things can change
    - During drafting, the paper can have simply a primary author (trainee) and senior author (Claudia) with the understanding at that point that even the primary authorship is not defined until the scope of the research contained, and the manuscript is actually at the submission stage  
- Please feel free to bring up questions about authorship with Claudia at any point
- If you leave the lab with unpublished work, you should talk to Claudia about plans to finish, submit, and revise. This may include revisiting authorship.
- We aim to publish all papers from the lab on pre-print servers such as arxiv and bioarxiv
- All abstracts, posters, talks, preprints and papers are representations of the lab and must be approved by Claudia before submission
