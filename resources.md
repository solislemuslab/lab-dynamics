There are many skills that we need to informally learn in academia: written and oral communication skills; reproducibility; lab dynamics like working on a team, giving/accepting constructive feedback; getting your own funding... Here I've compiled a list of resources (hopefully up to date) to learn more about some of those skills.

# Getting funding

Showing that you are able to acquire your own funding is very important in the academic landscape. Even if you are fully funded by your department or PI, consider applying to a scholarship or fellowship to learn valuable grant writing skills and improving your CV.
